# EpicMegaJam 2023 - Antiquated Future

"Stacky Towers" is a simple tower-builder game. First, the Planned Tower is generated on the left side of the screen. Then, players need to stack blocks in the correct positions and try to build a Tower that is as close as possible to the planned one. 

The "Main Menu" of the game is dynamic, showing a stack of blocks in the background:

The main gameplay loop. The Planned Tower has already been generated on the left. The player can press "Spacebar" to drop the current block:

In the end, the player receives a score based on how accurate their Tower is:
